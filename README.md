# Data-Modelling-and-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains data and code for the modelling and analysis of housing, broadband, and council tax in different areas of Oxfordshire. The goal of this project is to provide insights into the relationships and patterns within these three key aspects of the Oxfordshire region.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from the following:

- **Housing Data**: [Link to dataset/source]
- **Broadband Data**: [Link to dataset/source]
- **Council Tax Data**: [Link to dataset/source]

Please refer to the respective data sources for licensing and usage terms.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, modelling, and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Any custom scripts used in data processing or analysis.
- `reports/`: Any final reports, visualizations, or presentations.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the data, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/oxfordshire-data-analysis.git

Set up your environment. You may use conda, virtualenv, or any other preferred environment manager.

bash
Copy code
# Example using conda
conda create --name oxford-analysis python=3.8
conda activate oxford-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis process.
